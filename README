This is a simple demo program using PIC24 EPMP peripheral to drive HD44780-compatible LCD display.
The implementation details can be learned from the following article -> http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/driving-a-character-lcd-using-pic24-enhanced-parallel-master-port. The code was copy/pasted
from another project therefore the choice of MCU part, crystal speed and timer are somewhat arbitrary.
